<a id="description" class="anchor" href="#description" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Description</h2>

<p>This is a simple program to solve the "Vietnamese third grader" math problem described by <em>VN Express</em> and reported by <em>The Guardian</em> on Wednesday 20 May 2015 09.37 BST.
More information <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2015/may/20/can-you-do-the-maths-puzzle-for-vietnamese-eight-year-olds-that-has-stumped-parents-and-teachers">here</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, the problem requires students to figure out every missing digit in the equation below. The digits may range from 1 to 9, and are represented below by the letters <em>a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i</em>. The result of the operation is 66.</p>

<pre><code> | a |
 | + |
 | 13|
 | * |
 | b |
 | / |
 | c |
 | + |
 | d |
 | + |
 | 12|
 | * |
 | e |
 | - |
 | f |
 | - |
 | 11|
 | + |
 | g |
 | * |
 | h |
 | / |
 | i |
 | - |
 | 10|
 | = |
 | 66| &lt;--
</code></pre>

<p><strong>This program will output every solution possible</strong>. Setting output to a text file is <em>very</em> recommended!</p>

<p>Finding all solutions in the very same day that the problem was published was the main goal of this program -- not efficiency or code prettiness!
Therefore this program has the spaghettiest code that was ever spaghettied :)</p>

<p>__</p>

<p><em>Actually, if you look at the program logic, you'll notice that I'm running a second loop through a "solutions" data structure, which will increase the running time of the program. This is so all solutions can be collected and parsed into a neat output structure.</em></p>

<p><em>If you want to avoid this second loop, run the program with the "-noparse" argument! :)</em></p>

<p>__</p>

<p>Results when running on my machine:</p>

<pre><code>\*gigantic list of solutions\*

Number of solutions found: 442232

Time taken: 45 seconds.
</code></pre>

<p>If you're just looking for a single solution, here's one from the 442232 possible:</p>

<pre><code>9 + 13 * 9 / 9 + 9 + 12 * 5 - 9 - 11 + 9 * 5 / 9 - 10 = 66
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a id="perfect-solutions" class="anchor" href="#perfect-solutions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Perfect solutions</h2>

<p>The program supports perfect solutions -- that is, solutions where every digit is different. This will output every solution to this particular subproblem (which may be the main problem, depending on your definition of the original Vietnamese problem). To only get perfect solutions, run the program with the "-perfectsolutions" argument.</p>

<p>Results when running on my machine:</p>

<pre><code>\*list of perfect solutions\*

Number of perfect solutions found: 128

Time taken: 11 seconds.
</code></pre>

<p>If you're just looking for a single perfect solution, here's one from the 128 possible:</p>

<pre><code>9 + 13 * 8 / 6 + 2 + 12 * 4 - 1 - 11 + 7 * 5 / 3 - 10 = 66
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a id="whole-perfect-solutions" class="anchor" href="#whole-perfect-solutions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Whole Perfect solutions</h2>

<p>A subset of perfect solutions are whole perfect solutions -- perfect solutions where divisions with a remainder are excluded. This means that answers that require adding or subtracting fractions are not considered solutions (which would make sense to your average third grader!). To only get whole perfect solutions, run the program with the "-perfectwhole" argument.</p>

<p>Results when running on my machine:</p>

<pre><code>\*list of whole perfect solutions\*

Number of whole perfect solutions found: 20

Time taken: 12 seconds.
</code></pre>

<p>If you're just looking for a single whole perfect solution, here's one from the 20 possible:</p>

<pre><code>9 + 13 * 4 / 1 + 5 + 12 * 2 - 7 - 11 + 8 * 3 / 6 - 10 = 66
</code></pre>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Argument</th>
<th>Effect</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>(none)</td>
<td>Normal program execution, every solution will be output.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-onlyone</td>
<td>This will output only the first solution found (with the lowest possible values for a to i).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-random</td>
<td>This will output only ONE solution out of all solutions found. Great for getting a different solution every time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-noparse</td>
<td>This will output solutions as soon as they are found, skipping the generation and handling of a Solutions structure (you might not want to print the output to a file when using this argument).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>-perfectsolutions</strong></td>
<td>This will output only perfect solutions (as described above). <strong>Some versions of this problem only accept perfect solutions as the answer!</strong>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>-perfectwhole</strong></td>
<td>This will output only whole perfect solutions (as described above). <strong>Some versions of this problem only accept whole perfect solutions as the answer!</strong>
</td>

<p>Only one argument may be passed to the program.</p>
