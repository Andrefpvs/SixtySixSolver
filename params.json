The digits may range from 1 to 9, and are represented below by the letters *a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i*. The result of the operation is 66.\r\n\r\n\t | a |\r\n\t | + |\r\n\t | 13|\r\n\t | * |\r\n\t | b |\r\n\t | / |\r\n\t | c |\r\n\t | + |\r\n\t | d |\r\n\t | 12|\r\n\t | * |\r\n\t | e |\r\n\t | - |\r\n\t | f |\r\n\t | - |\r\n\t | 11|\r\n\t | + |\r\n\t | g |\r\n\t | * |\r\n\t | h |\r\n\t | / |\r\n\t | i |\r\n\t | - |\r\n\t | 10|\r\n\t | = |\r\n\t | 66| <--\r\n\t \r\n**This program will output every solution possible**. Setting output to a text file is *very* recommended!\r\n\r\nFinding all solutions was the main goal of this program -- not efficiency!\r\nTherefore this program has \"**O(n!)**\" (factorial) complexity (with *n* restricted from 1 to 9).\r\n\r\n__\r\n\r\n*Actually, if you look at the program logic, you'll notice that I'm running a second loop through a \"solutions\" data structure, which will increase the running time of the program. Why am I using that structure? Initially I had planned to do some more things with the solutions, however...!*\r\n\r\n*If you want to avoid this second loop, run the program with the \"-noparse\" argument! :)*\r\n\r\n__\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults when running on my machine:\r\n\r\n\t\\*gigantic list of solutions\\*\r\n\r\n\tNumber of solutions found: 3359844\r\n\r\n\tTime taken: 219 seconds.\r\n\t\r\nIf you're just looking for a single solution, here's one from the 3359844 possible:\r\n\r\n\t9 + 13 * 9 / 9 + 8 + 12 * 4 - 3 - 11 + 6 * 4 / 2 - 10 = 66\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n## Perfect solutions\r\n\r\nThe program supports perfect solutions -- that is, solutions where every digit is different. This will output every solution to this particular subproblem (which may be the main problem, depending on your definition of the original Vietnamese problem. To only get perfect solutions, run the program with the \"-perfectsolutions\" argument.\r\n\r\nResults when running on my machine:\r\n\r\n\t\\*list of perfect solutions\\*\r\n\r\n\tNumber of perfect solutions found: 2672\r\n\r\n\tTime taken: 17 seconds.\r\n\t\r\nIf you're just looking for a single perfect solution, here's one from the 2672 possible:\r\n\r\n\t9 + 13 * 8 / 7 + 6 + 12 * 5 - 2 - 11 + 3 * 1 / 4 - 10 = 66\r\n\r\n\r\n## Program arguments\r\n\t\r\n| Argument      | Effect                                                                                      |\r\n|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| (none)\t    | Normal program execution, every solution will be output.\t\t\t\t      |\r\n| -onlyone      | This will output only the first solution found (with the lowest possible values for a to i).|\r\n| -random       | This will output only ONE solution out of all solutions found. Great for getting a different solution every time.|\r\n| -noparse      | This will output solutions as soon as they are found, skipping the generation and handling of a Solutions structure (you might not want to print the output to a file when using this argument).|\r\n| **-perfectsolutions** | This will output only perfect solutions (as described in the section above). **Some versions of this problem only accept perfect solutions as the answer!**|\r\n\r\nOnly one argument may be passed to the program.\r\n \r\n*This product is distributed as Java source files. You will need to compile it on your machine for it to run. Program arguments require a terminal or console.*","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
